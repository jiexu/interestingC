2.1
        it is possible to declare something like this: typedef struct x3 { ... } x3
        because the first x3 (tag) and the second x3 (ordinary identifier) live in different namespace

2.10:
        pass constant values to functions which accept structure arguements:
        plotpoint((struct point){1, 2}), or /*compound literals*/
        plotpoint((struct point){.x=1, .y=2}) /* with designated initilizers" */
