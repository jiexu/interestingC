5.1:
        NULL pointer is not necessarily represented as 0 in the code, but it is the comiler's job to expands to an implementation-defined null pointer constant

5.15:
        when you want a null pointer constant in source code, use "0" or "NULL"
        if the usage of "0" or "NULL" is an argument in a function call, cast it to the pointer type expected by the function being called.
